# Initiatives

An _initiative_ is a collection of one or more milestones that, taken together, address one or more themes. Initiatives map to major projects that the Releng team would like to accomplish, and can be either new functionality or substantial reworks of existing functionality. Depending on the project area, an initiative can be a thin wrapper around a single milestone if that milestone is high value and self-contained.

The following are the current initiatives:

Ability to run tests in quarantine as part of new config process, desire to reduce load on code sheriffs, existing processes depend on activedata which isn't well supported anymore

Firefox Lite is no longer supported, but we want to create a few more releases to notify users and send them to other products. We no longer have a team creating these releases; let's help the mobile team get these releases signed and shipped.

Make Snap the default format on Ubuntu. This will make a Mozilla build the default, rather than a distribution rebuild. There may be contracts involved.

[*Associated Epics*](https://jira.mozilla.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20RELENG%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Epic%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20firefox-snap-default)

## mobile-task-robustness

Intermittent failures are forcing mobile developers to rerun 100+ tasks instead of automatically rerunning; let's improve that.

[*Associated Epics*](https://jira.mozilla.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20RELENG%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Epic%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20mobile-task-robustness)

## linux-arm64-ci
*Add support for Linux ARM64 in the CI*

Better ARM64 automated testing overall. M1 automatic testing will be hard at scale. Testing more on Linux will help identifying CPU specific issue for both Linux and Apple Silicon since they are very similar. Would help for mobile too since most of Android is ARM64.

[*Associated Epics*](https://jira.mozilla.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20RELENG%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Epic%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20linux-arm64-ci)

## deprecate-l10n-repacks
*Work with l10n team to deprecate l10n repacks*

There is momentum from the l10n team on this. This would exponentially reduce taskgraph complexity and release end-to-end times. We would reduce the number of shipping desktop binaries exponentially. Repacks are also significantly less discoverable or configurable on shared/multilingual usersâ€™ machines than langpacks could be.

*Valuing Bug Sources*

We pay a significant amount to various sources to file new bugs. By creating a tool to show relative values of each bug filing source, we can determine whether each is worth the cost.

## push-riskiness
*Team view of riskiness of pushes*

The idea is to move some of the knowledge and responsibility that is currently RelManâ€™s and spread it across engineering teams. Distributed responsibility should make it easier to control quality, since each team will take ownership of quality for the components they own rather than relying on a small "third-party" team to oversee everything.
