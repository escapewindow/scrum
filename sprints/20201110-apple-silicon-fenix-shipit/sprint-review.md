# Sprint review - Apple Silicon and Fenix on Shipit, October 26, 2020 - November 6, 2020

Or, "There's no perfect time to start sprints".

While members of the Releng team had participated in scrum at other companies, a number of us were new to agile, and none of us had Scrum Master experience. But we knew we needed to change how we worked with our reduced team size and combined team structure.

A number of team members had PTO booked, meaning there was no perfect two-week span for our first sprint before US Thanksgiving week. We decided that starting the sprints on an imperfect week was preferable over waiting for some mythical perfect time.

Aki had the most background from the [Taskcluster team's sprints](https://github.com/taskcluster/scrum/) and planned to help keep things on track in week 2, after coming back from PTO. However, life happened, and he was out both weeks, on bereavement leave.

We tried two parallel sprints, one per epic, and some non-sprinting team members to handle interrupts and releaseduty. We largely didn't use JIRA to track things. There was no Product Owner on the Apple Silicon sprint. Mihai was understandably unable to handle both his new management role and the Scrum Master role, so we were Scrum-Master-less as well.

We decided we hadn't tried a real sprint yet. We wanted to try a real sprint in Sprint 2.

## Details

**Product Owner**:
- Apple Silicon: none
- Fenix on Shipit: jlorenzo
**Scrum Master**: None

## Goal

One main goal was to start sprinting and see how Agile worked for us.

Another was to complete the Fenix-on-Shipit epic, which was already well-scoped and split into discrete tasks.

Yet another, based on Apple's release schedule, was to support the Apple Silicon version of Firefox.

### Epics
1. [Apple Silicon tests](https://jira.mozilla.com/browse/RELENG-79)
2. [Support and release Fenix through Shipit](https://jira.mozilla.com/browse/RELENG-6)

## Outcomes

Fenix on Shipit was largely completed, though Shipit wasn't as new-developer-friendly as it could have been, which slowed down our efforts to ramp up Cam.

We got Apple Silicon work done, but without anyone driving the epic or sprint, it was less of a sprint and more of a few people working on a shared area of responsibility.

We definitely came out of the sprint with a lot of questions to answer before Sprint 2.

## Feedback

There was little review, mostly retrospective.
