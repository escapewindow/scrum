# Sprint retrospective - Apple Silicon and Fenix on Shipit, October 26, 2020 - November 6, 2020

## Initial retrospective

- We were confused about sprint terminology, which our meeting with Coop helped clear up.
- We weren't using JIRA's sprint option, and decided to start in Sprint 2.
- We knew we were missing the Scrum Master role.
- We wanted to set story points and split stories into more granular pieces before the next sprint.
- We found timezone mismatches caused us to work outside our normal working hours.
- Having the team split between two different sprints meant there was less collaboration and cross-training than we wanted. It also meant that it seemed less possible to have team members help out on a sprint they weren't a part of.
- Shipit had ramp-up issues: it wasn't easy to pick up the project as a new developer and get started quickly. This is something we need to address in any projects we own.
- Releng lost a significant part of institutional knowledge.
- The shipit sprint didn’t have daily standups per se.

## Coop meeting

After our first sprint retrospective, we sent our notes to Coop, who had run the Taskcluster team's sprints as Scrum Master.

He had several high value suggestions:

- Limit how many things we change at once! Just a few high value changes each iteration.
- Roles have value. Product owner can be involved in sprint. Scrum Master shouldn't be assigned sprint tasks while we're figuring out our process.
- There can be multiple epics per sprint.
- He suggested ~1 story point per day per person, ~4 story points per week per person. (We have since moved away from the story point to time conversion.)
- Add a releaseduty epic with 5 story points to the sprint.
- Everyone is part of the sprint; rather than have 2 parallel sprints, have one with multiple epics. The epics don't necessarily have to be related. This will reduce overhead and create a sprint where people can help out across epics.
  - (This was probably the most valuable piece of advice.)
- There could be multiple product owners (epic champions could be their own product owner).

## Process changes for next sprint

- We shouldn’t try to change too many things at once. Limit ourselves to max two changes for the next iteration
- We should have a dedicated Scrum Master to help with the mechanics (Mihai)
- Break roadmap initiatives into less-than-3week epics
- from there into smaller stories with priorities + story points (~1 day per story point)
- cross-training should be an emphasis in the next sprint
- Make sure we track interruptudy as well with story points for that week.
- Find a way to track the next most important thing
